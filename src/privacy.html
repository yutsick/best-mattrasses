                <p class="mb-4">BY USING OR ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS
                    PRIVACY POLICY. **GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Users of the Website Generally**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">“Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of
                    additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person.
                    “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address
                    that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person. Like most website operators,
                    Company gathers from users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that
                    Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the user’s
                    Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type and the locations of the websites the
                    user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website.
                    Although such information is not Personally-Identifying Information, it may be possible for Company
                    to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service provider and the geographic location of
                    the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes
                    Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website to help Company better
                    understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is
                    able to better design the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease
                    of use. From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information
                    gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage
                    of the Website.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Web Cookies**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that
                    a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time
                    the user submits a query to the website. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of services you
                    have used, to record registration information regarding your login name and password, to record your
                    user preferences, to keep you logged into the Website and to facilitate purchase procedures. Company
                    also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both to help
                    Company improve users’ experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As
                    with other Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company
                    analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help
                    Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET
                    THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT
                    CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE
                    USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Third-Party Advertisers**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Website.
                    These companies may use information (not including any Personally-Identifying Information) about
                    your visits to the Website and other websites that are contained in Web Cookies in order to provide
                    advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Using a tool created by the Network
                    Advertising Initiative, you can opt out of several third-party ad servers’ and networks’ Web Cookies
                    simultaneously. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices
                    about not having this information used by these companies, please follow the following links:
                    http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/, or
                    http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. Please contact us if you would like to know the identity of the
                    third-party advertising companies we are currently using to serve ads. We may allow advertisers to
                    choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements, and we may use any of the
                    Non-Personally Identifying Information we have collected (including information you may have decided
                    not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or
                    preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements. We do not identify you to
                    the advertiser.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Web Beacons**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page or email that is usually
                    invisible to the user and allows website operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular
                    web page or an email. Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count users who
                    have visited particular pages, viewed emails and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not
                    used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information. They are a technique Company may use to
                    compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of
                    information, including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view and a description
                    of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they
                    can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify
                    you each time a Web Cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an
                    individual basis.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Analytics**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as
                    the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to
                    inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past activity on the Website, including Google
                    Analytics for Display Advertising. The information collected may be used to, among other things,
                    analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online
                    activity. If you do not want any information to be collected and used by Google Analytics, you can
                    install an opt-out in your web browser (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out
                    from Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network by using Google’s Ads
                    Settings (www.google.com/settings/ads).</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Aggregated and Non-Personally-Identifying Information**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect under any
                    of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies to
                    develop and deliver targeted advertising on the Website and on websites of third parties. We may
                    combine Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying
                    Information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third
                    parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general
                    business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to the Website
                    and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any
                    Personally-Identifying Information and may be used to develop website content and services that we
                    hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Mobile Device Additional Terms**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• Mobile Device. If you use a mobile device to access the Website or download any of our
                    applications, we may collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model and
                    manufacturer), operating system, version information and IP address.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• Geo-Location Information. Unless we have received your prior consent, we do not access
                    or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or
                    using our mobile application or our services, except that it may be possible for Company to
                    determine from an IP address the geographic location of your point of connectivity, in which case we
                    may gather and use such general location data.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• Push Notifications. We send you push notifications if you choose to receive them,
                    letting you know when someone has sent you a message or for other service-related matters. If you
                    wish to opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device’s
                    settings.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• Mobile Analytics. We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand
                    the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information, such
                    as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated
                    usage, performance data and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the
                    information we store within the analytics software to any Personally-Identifying Information you
                    submit within the mobile application.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Online Postings**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users may be disclosed as a
                    matter of course as a result of your use of the Website. We may provide areas on the Website where
                    you can post reviews and other information relating to your activities on the Website. Such postings
                    are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when
                    searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose
                    personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and
                    can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive
                    unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the
                    information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with
                    respect to your personal information.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM
                    THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Company Communications**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding
                    new services offered by the Website that we think you may find valuable. We may also send you
                    service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.
                    Generally, you may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or through your account
                    settings, though we reserve the right to send you notices about your account, such as service
                    announcements and administrative messages, even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">**Company Disclosures**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Company will disclose Personally-Identifying Information under the following
                    circumstances:</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• By Law or to Protect Rights. When we believe disclosure is appropriate, we may
                    disclose Personally-Identifying Information in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent or
                    take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and
                    defend the rights, property or safety of Company, our users, our employees or others; to comply with
                    applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or
                    policies, in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order or a request for
                    cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal
                    rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise
                    or waive any legal objection or right available to us.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• Marketing Communications. Unless users opt-out from receiving Company marketing
                    materials upon registration, Company may email users about products and services that Company
                    believes may be of interest to them. If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from
                    Company, you may do so by following the unsubscribe link in the email communications, by going to
                    your account settings (if applicable) or contacting us using the contact information below.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• Third-Party Marketing Communications. Unless users opt-out from receiving marketing
                    materials upon registration, Company may provide users’ email information to third parties, so that
                    those third parties may directly contact them about additional products and services. To cease
                    having your email information provided to third parties, you may do so by going to your account
                    settings (if applicable) or contacting us using the contact information below. Even after
                    opting-out, you may continue to receive marketing emails from third parties to whom Company already
                    has provided your email information. You will be responsible for directly contacting such third
                    parties to request cessation of further marketing emails.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your Personally-Identifying Information,
                    which may include your name and contact information (including email address) with our authorized
                    service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling
                    orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis,
                    supporting the Website’s functionality and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other

                    card information with our authorized service providers who process credit card payments. These
                    service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are
                    not permitted to share or use such information for any other purpose.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">• Business Transfers; Bankruptcy. Company reserves the right to transfer all
                    Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a
                    merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Company’s assets. Other than to
                    the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred
                    Personally-Identifying Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy
                    policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to
                    affirmatively opt-out of it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted or collected after a
                    transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor organization.</p>

                    and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Website (1) to deliver
                    the products and services that you have requested; (2) to manage your account and provide you with
                    customer support; (3) to communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices

                    on the Website and other sites; (5) to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems; (6) to measure

                    may look across multiple users to identify problems. In particular, we may examine your
                    Personally-Identifying Information to identify users using multiple user IDs or aliases. We may
                    compare and review your Personally-Identifying Information for accuracy and to detect errors and
                    omissions. We may use financial information or payment method to process payment for any purchases
                    made on the Website, enroll you in the discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to
                    participate, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions and otherwise as needed
                    to manage our business.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Company contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers from
                    disclosing Personally-Identifying Information received from Company, other than in accordance with
                    this Privacy Policy. However, third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy
                    Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to those third
                    parties, or that those third parties collect for themselves. These third parties include
                    advertisers, providers of games, utilities, widgets and a variety of other third-party applications
                    accessible through the Website. Company neither owns nor controls the third-party websites and
                    applications accessible through the Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information
                    provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third party, or
                    using a third-party application, whether by means of a link on the Website, directly through the
                    Website or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any such third
                    party, users should inform themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third
                    party responsible for that website or application, and should take those steps necessary to, in
                    those users’ discretion, protect their privacy.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**SECURITY**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">We take the security of your Personally-Identifying Information seriously and use
                    reasonable electronic, personnel and physical measures to protect it from loss, theft, alteration or
                    misuse. However, please be advised that even the best security measures cannot fully eliminate all
                    risks. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We are not
                    responsible for third-party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures. We are
                    dedicated to protect all information on the Website as is necessary. However, you are responsible
                    for maintaining the confidentiality of your Personally-Identifying Information by keeping your
                    password confidential. You should change your password immediately if you believe someone has gained
                    unauthorized access to it or your account. If you lose control of your account, you should notify us
                    immediately.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Company may, in its sole discretion, change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any
                    and all changes to Company’s Privacy Policy will be reflected on this page and the date new versions
                    are posted will be stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current
                    Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. Users should
                    regularly check this page for any changes to this Privacy Policy. Company will always post new
                    versions of the Privacy Policy on the Website. However, Company may, as determined in its
                    discretion, decide to notify users of changes made to this Privacy Policy via email or otherwise.
                    Accordingly, it is important that users always maintain and update their contact information.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**CHILDREN**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") protects the online privacy of
                    children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personally-Identifying
                    Information from anyone under the age of 13, unless or except as permitted by law. Any person who
                    provides Personally-Identifying Information through the Website represents to us that he or she is
                    13 years of age or older. If we learn that Personally-Identifying Information has been collected
                    from a user under 13 years of age on or through the Website, then we will take the appropriate steps
                    to cause this information to be deleted. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13
                    who has become a member of the Website or has otherwise transferred Personally-Identifying
                    Information to the Website, please contact Company using our contact information below to have that
                    child's account terminated and information deleted.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits
                    our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of
                    charge, information about the Personally-Identifying Information (if any) we disclosed to third
                    parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this
                    information would include a list of the categories of the Personally-Identifying Information that
                    was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared
                    Personally-Identifying Information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
                    California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to
                    our privacy officer as listed below.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">**DO-NOT-TRACK POLICY**</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
                    feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
                    online browsing activities monitored and collected. Because there is not yet a common understanding
                    of how to interpret the DNT signal, the Website currently does not respond to DNT browser signals or
                    mechanisms.</p>
